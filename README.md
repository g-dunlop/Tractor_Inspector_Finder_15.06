# TractorFactor - Tractor Inspector Finder

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This was a 12-day group project completed during weeks 15 and 16 of the CodeClan course by Graeme and Christian.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Spring Boot</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>React Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Google Maps API/Distance Matrix</li>
  <li>Git</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Project Brief</h2>
 <p>An online tractor auction site has requested an app to help increase the efficiency of their after-sale process.  Once a tractor is sold, as part of their service, the site arranges for a qualified expert to inspect the tractor and authenticate the product for sale.  The site has requested an app which will allow them to find the closest inspectors to the tractor easily.</p>
 
 <h4>MVP</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>A user should be able to:
    <ul>
      <li>Enter a postcode and a type of tractor in order to find the closest inspectors</li>
      <li>See these inspectors on a map</li>
      <li>See the road distance from inspector to tractor</li>
      <li>Perform basic CRUD functions on the database: Add tractors and inspectors, update and delete inspectors and search the database by name of inspector</li>
      <li>Use the app from a mobile device</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 
 <h4>Possible Extensions</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>The user can give ratings to inspectors and make notes on them</li>
  <li>The ability to book an inspection via the app(this would, however, require more data about the purchased item from the auction site.</li>
  <li>Authentication and login. (Although in this case, there is only one user for the site.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Planning</h2>
 <p>The below images demonstrate some of our planning for the MVP stage of the project.  We made use of a MSCW board, class diagrams and wireframes</p>
